A First Coding Challenge from Lumoshive Academy in November 2025

## Description
There is an equation in a string form: `a + b = c`. But, there is a reversed number in it. So, find the number and replace it with a new number that should be.

## Input
- Equation string = `a + b = c`
- Formation = **number + number = number**

## Output
- Correct, if the addition result is true
- The reversed **a** number, if **a** is false
- The reversed **b** number, if **b** is false
- The reversed **c** number, if **c** is false
- No solution, if all numbers are not suitable

### Example
`12 + 34 = 64` -> **c,46**\
`16 + 23 = 93` -> **c,39**\
`15 + 51 = 66` -> **correct**\
`21 + 34 = 55` -> **correct**
